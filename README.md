# Minecraft Server Configurations

This repository contains configurations, plugin lists, and setup files for my Minecraft servers, organized by server type and version.

### Directory Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific server version or modpack configuration. 

Below is an overview of the current setups:

- [**Paper 1.21.3**](./vanilla-1.21.3/) <br>
  Configuration files and plugins for the latest Vanilla Paper 1.21.3 server setup.
