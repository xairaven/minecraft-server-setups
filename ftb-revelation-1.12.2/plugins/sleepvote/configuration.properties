#### Counting Required Players ####
# You are given two options: percent and number
# If both are specified, the plugin will choose the lower of the two requirements

# Below are some presets. '%' is the value for "required_percent_sleeping" and '#' is the value for "required_number_sleeping"

# Preset: Percent Only (Default)
# '%' = <any percent>
# '#' = 0

# Preset: Number Only
# '%' = 1.0
# '#' = <any number>

# Preset: Dynamic
# The plugin will choose the smaller of the two requirements. (e.g. Say the population is 50 and '%' = 0.5 and '#' = 10. The plugin will choose 10 as a requirement rather than 25 (which is 50 * 0.5))
# '%' = <any percent>
# '#' = <any number>

# Now here's the fun part. You decide how you want it!

# Percentage of players (in a world) required to be sleeping in order to advance through the night
# Must be a value in the inclusive range of [0.0,1.0]. If set to zero, it will only require one player
"required_percent_sleeping" = 0.4

# Number of players (in a world) required to be sleeping in order to advance through the night
# If there are less players than what is specified, then it will use the percentage instead
# Set to a value less than or equal to (<=) 0 to disable. It is disabled by default
"required_number_sleeping" = 0

#### Messages ####

# <player> is the name of the player who just went in/out of bed
# <sleeping> is the number of sleeping players in the world
# <required> is the number of players in the world required to be sleeping in order to advance through the night
# <percent> is simply the percentage of players sleeping out of the number of players required to sleep. Calculated internally as '(sleeping / required) * 100'

# Formatting codes may be used in messages using '\u00A7' (e.g. "\u00A7cHello!" is will print "Hello!" in red text)

# Toggle on/off the logging of the wakeup, enter_bed, and exit_bed messages messages in the server console, prefixed by the world name

#### Counted Game Modes ####
# Determine which game modes are ignored when counting up players
# A value of 'true' means that players with that game mode will be ignored

}

#### Administration ####
# If set to true, players with the permission 'sleepvote.hidden' will be ignored, regardless of their status when using the '/sleepvote hide' command. This includes ops
# Set to false by default since some people have been confused, claiming that the plugin "didn't work" when they slept simply because they were trying it out while in op
# The advantage of this is that it persists across server restarts whereas '/sleepvote hide' does not.

#### Nucleus Integration ####
# The following options require Nucleus in order to work

# Recommended: remove the permission 'nucleus.afk.base' (access to the '/afk' command) from players so that this feature is not abused
"ignore_afk_players" = false
